# Harvestify

Harvestify is a comprehensive project that brings together machine learning and deep learning models to assist farmers in optimizing their crop management. The project includes three main components:

## 1. Crop Recommender

The Crop Recommender is a machine learning model designed to recommend suitable crops based on various input parameters such as soil nutrients, temperature, humidity, and rainfall. The model leverages Flask to provide a user-friendly web interface for farmers to input their data and receive personalized crop recommendations.

## 2. Fertilizer Recommender

The Fertilizer Recommender utilizes machine learning to recommend appropriate fertilizers based on soil and environmental conditions. Similar to the Crop Recommender, this model is deployed using Flask, offering a seamless web experience for farmers to input data and receive fertilizer recommendations.

## 3. Crop Disease Detection

The Crop Disease Detection component employs deep learning techniques to identify diseases in crops by analyzing images. The model is integrated into a web interface powered by Flask, allowing users to upload images for disease diagnosis. The results include information about the detected disease, providing farmers with valuable insights for crop management.

## Additional Web Pages

In addition to the machine learning models, the project features several web pages:

- **Calendar Page (Calender.html):** A page providing information related to agricultural events and activities, helping farmers plan their schedules.

- **Process Page (Process.html):** An informative page outlining the processes involved in the project, offering transparency on how the recommendations are generated.

- **Contact Page (Contact.html):** A working contact page allowing users to submit queries and feedback. Note that for the contact form to function, users need to replace the API key in `contact.html` with their own EmailJS API key.

## Prerequisites
